# Coding standard

We wil enforce Clean Code at PR review:

 - Read the `Clean Code` book of Robert Martin (Request William to receive ebook version)
 - The consumed rules of `Clean Code` [here](./clean_code_rule.md)

Learning the principles of Clean Code is an ***extremely high ROI*** investment. Followers write maintainable, testable, debuggable code that saves the company millions of dollars in dev time and reduced outages.
